# Introduction
Since 2018 the United States of America and China have been in a trade confrontation, which has resulted in several rounds of tariff to each other. The tariffs have had a tremendous impact on National Electrical Manufacturer Association (NEMA) members. This report investigates the impact of US-China trade war on the electrical manufacturing industry. Based on analysis, this industry experienced stop of growth and decrease in profitability. To be more specific, the tariff increase both the direct costs of import and the indirect legislation/operational costs, which makes the industry less competitive and brings negative long-term effect.

The team, in order to determine a course of action for NEMA, constructed a case study on GE to see possible ways in which solution could be implemented. The report explains that, though GE faced standard problems of cost increase that all NEMA members faced, the company found several solutions to mitigate the effect of the tariffs. Together with its auditor and partner KPMG, GE proposes several approaches to mitigate the cost of the tariffs including applying for exclusion, change of product origin, applying first sale, negotiating suppliers, and strategic sourcing/change of suppliers.

Overall, the result shows that the tariffs placed by the US on Chinese goods not only hurt China, but also hurt its Electrical Manufacturing Industry. Thus, our recommendations for NEMA and NEMA members for reducing cost of tariffs are:

1. NEMA should place pressure on both the United States government and Chinese government to end the trade war, return to negotiation and sign a fair agreement. Footwear firms has already placed pressure on the government and made some progress.

2. Members of NEMA may consider applying short term tariffs reduction practices, including application for exclusion, change of origin. But those approaches may not be economically friendly to small firms.

3. Members of NEMA should consider relocate suppliers to the SEA region, especially Vietnam. However, those countries may not have enough working population and infrastructure so that cost may still be higher than pre-tariff Chinese imported goods.
